The goal of this course is to investigate the religious and political dimensions of memory, self-cultivation, and contemplation.

Many mythologies include these supernatural characters, and not just modern fiction is full of encounters between normal humans and these human-like creatures. As almost all of these non-human actors are either imaginary or (in the case of aliens, robots, and AIs) highly speculative, one must ask why there is this fascination with beings that are somehow like us, but different, a fascination that stretches over thousands of years. This course explores the rich tradition of non-human beings in literature, art, movies, and computer games, in pursuit of the question what it is to be human.
